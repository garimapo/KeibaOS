## Phase77 implementation report

Phase: `POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_77`

State: `IMPLEMENTED_FOR_REVIEW`

Outcome: `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW`

Support Repair: `PHASE50_V3_DEDICATED_TEST_PATH_SUPPORT_ADDED`

Starting HEAD/tree: `c6522eacf46f03036e1171f14f634983c1f73479` / `e5df986b4788afb3a22507767767580ad399a880`

Phase76 is frozen `DESIGN_BLOCKED_ADDITIONAL_SUPPORT_REQUIRED`. Its primary blocker was `PHASE50_V3_DEDICATED_TEST_PATH_ALLOWLIST_MISSING`; the separate `PUBLICATION_COMMIT_PUSH_ROLLBACK_BOUNDARY_REQUIRES_DESIGN_CORRECTION` remains for the corrected later publication design. Before commit the live publication delta remains rollback-capable; after a successful commit, push failure must preserve the local commit and enter integration recovery rather than reset, amend, force, reacquire, or restart the publication transaction.

Phase50 now accepts exactly the historical V1 path, V2 path, and `tests/test_nar_race_entry_status_source_profile_v3_fixtures.py`. It rejects all malformed V3 variants and arbitrary paths. Journal schema `1`, milestone order, `{test_path}` detail shape, size limits, outcomes, authorization states, and existing V3 manifest identity-pair support are unchanged. A successful V3 publication journal using V3 fixture/qualification identities and the V3 dedicated path passes syntax, semantic validation, and reconstruction with publication begun and no rollback.

Verification: Phase50 `367 passed`; publication plan `45 passed`; publication contract `49 passed`; full repository `4349 passed, 2841 subtests passed`. Provider HTTP / Phase44 / GET: `0 / 0 / 0`. Acquisition authorization: `NONE`. Publication authorization: `NONE`. Publication: `NO`.

Phase75 remains `FORMALLY_COMPLETE`; Phase74 authorization remains permanently consumed fail-closed. Market eligibility remains `UNSUPPORTED`; no historical inference is made.

## Phase76 publication preparation report

Phase: `POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_76`

Status: `DRAFT_FOR_REVIEW`

Outcome: `READY_FOR_APPROVAL`

Design Contract: `V3_FRESH_CURRENT_ACQUISITION_AND_PUBLICATION_CONTRACT_COMPLETE`

Worktree: `C:\Users\garim\Desktop\KeibaOS-post-v0.8`

Current support HEAD/tree: `c6522eacf46f03036e1171f14f634983c1f73479` / `e5df986b4788afb3a22507767767580ad399a880`

Phase75 is frozen `FORMALLY_COMPLETE` with `PHASE75_IMPLEMENTATION_REMOTE_VERIFICATION_PASS`; its V3 publication-plan authority, exact six-path plan, closed FixtureSetV3 validation, `VALIDATE_ONLY` attribute policy, and tracked V3 binary rule are available. Phase74 remains final with permanently consumed Phase74 authorization; its raw bytes were cleaned and cannot be reconstructed or reused.

Preparation found no additional support gap. The exact four V3 CREATE_ONLY targets are absent, and the committed V3 `.gitattributes` rule is present. Phase76 reserves, but does not issue, `PHASE76_V3_SOURCE_PROFILE_PUBLICATION_AUTHORIZATION_UNCONSUMED` bound only to `NAR / 21 / 2025-01-01 / 6`, purpose `FRESH_CURRENT_V3_SOURCE_PROFILE_ACQUISITION_AND_PUBLICATION`, current-acquisition semantics, and the current support HEAD. Its sole post-boundary state is permanent consumed fail-closed.

The reviewed future execution uses a one-time frozen external runner; namespace-package import isolation; complete synthetic qualification, Phase50 blocked-payload, V3 contract, test-template, rollback, attribute, and CREATE_ONLY absence gates; then exactly one Phase44 and at most two ordered GETs. It retains the same fresh raw bytes through all qualification and V3 authority construction. Only fully qualified same-byte evidence may reach `PUBLICATION_BEGIN`, raw fixture readback, manifest readback, deterministic dedicated test generation, documentation update, regression tests, six-path staging, commit, and normal push. Any post-publication failure rolls back exactly the six live paths and does not retry.

Current-acquisition semantics are preserved throughout: no historical bytes, provider availability, timing, cutoff, or market eligibility are inferred. `market_eligibility`, `positive_market_eligibility`, and `WHOLE_MEETING_CANCELLATION` remain `UNSUPPORTED`.

Readiness A–T: `YES`. Provider HTTP / Phase44 / GET: `0 / 0 / 0`. Authorization issued: `NONE`. Publication: `NOT PERFORMED`. Staged: empty. Untracked: empty.

Next recommended action: `CHATGPT_REVIEW_PHASE76_PUBLICATION_DESIGN`.

## Phase75 implementation report

Phase: `POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_75`

State: `IMPLEMENTED_FOR_REVIEW`

Outcome: `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW`

Support: `V3_SOURCE_PROFILE_PUBLICATION_PLAN_AUTHORITY_IMPLEMENTED`

The implementation adds additive, deterministic, fail-closed V3 publication-plan authority while preserving all V2 constants, types, paths, builders, validators, and tests. It introduces `SourceProfilePublicationPlanV3`, exact `FixtureSetV3` input validation, exact V3 NAR target/path authority, ordered six-role plans, future `VALIDATE_ONLY` gitattributes policy, exact rollback scope, and the frozen V3 fixture-test requirement tuple. V2 and V3 inputs and plan types cross-reject; the V3 plan has no independent identity.

The V3 HTML binary rule is now tracked exactly once: `tests/fixtures/nar_race_entry_status/source_profiles/v3/**/*.html -text -diff`; the V2 rule remains exactly once. The plan module remains pure: no network, subprocess, filesystem write, raw bytes, arbitrary URLs, or live acquisition capability.

Phase74 remains `FORMALLY_COMPLETE` with evidence review `PHASE74_VERSIONED_VALIDATION_EVIDENCE_REVIEW_PASS`; its authorization remains permanently consumed fail-closed. Raw V3 fixtures and manifests are `NOT_PUBLISHED`. Future publication requires a new one-shot authorization bound to the reviewed post-Phase75 support. Market eligibility remains `UNSUPPORTED`; no historical inference is made.

Verification completed: publication-plan tests `45 passed`; publication-contract tests `49 passed`; specified related diagnostics/Profile-A/Phase66/Phase50 regressions `562 passed`; full repository suite `4337 passed, 2841 subtests passed`. Provider HTTP / Phase44 / GET: `0 / 0 / 0`. Acquisition authorization: `NONE`. Publication: `NO`.

## Phase75 preparation report

Phase: `POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_75`

Status: `DRAFT_FOR_REVIEW`

Outcome: `READY_FOR_APPROVAL`

Design Contract: `V3_SOURCE_PROFILE_PUBLICATION_PLAN_CONTRACT_COMPLETE`

Worktree: `C:\Users\garim\Desktop\KeibaOS-post-v0.8`

Starting tracking HEAD: `11e1aace4aae68640d0d38f88b38873d1bac5abd`

Validated executable support HEAD/tree: `b2355113f969f6af713a254355e67a9feab5cc45` / `24b4f37391039e1ece2d573b4a0ea3f0de65e4cd`

Phase74 is frozen `FORMALLY_COMPLETE` with evidence review `PHASE74_VERSIONED_VALIDATION_EVIDENCE_REVIEW_PASS`, outcome `READY_FOR_REVIEW`, and permanently consumed authorization `PHASE74_VERSIONED_SOURCE_PROFILE_VALIDATION_AUTHORIZATION_CONSUMED_FAIL_CLOSED`. Its current-only Profile-B v2 `QUALIFIED`, Safety v3 `SAFE`, Profile-A v3 `QUALIFIED`, durable boundary, Phase44 `1`, total GET `2`, retry `0`, and no-publication result remain evidence only. Raw bytes are unavailable and must not be reconstructed or substituted.

Preparation confirmed that V3 contract authority already exists: exact `FixtureSetV3`, `QualificationV3`, `SourceProfileManifestV3`, `RawFixturePublicationSafetyV3`, their V3 builders/validators, deterministic V3 paths, semantics `CURRENT_ACQUISITION_CONCERNING_HISTORICAL_TARGET`, and market eligibility `UNSUPPORTED`.

The existing publication plan is strictly V2-only: it accepts only exact `FixtureSetV2`, uses V2 fixture paths and requirements, and preserves Phase57 V2 authority. `.gitattributes` presently preserves only V2 source-profile HTML. A direct V3 publication is therefore not authorized.

The reviewed additive Phase75 implementation is limited to five paths:

1. `scripts/simulation/nar_race_entry_status_source_profile_publication_plan.py`
2. `tests/test_nar_race_entry_status_source_profile_publication_plan.py`
3. `.gitattributes`
4. `docs/CURRENT_PHASE.md`
5. `docs/LATEST_CODEX_REPORT.md`

It will retain every V2 type, constant, path, builder, validator, and golden behavior unchanged; add a distinct exact-FixtureSetV3 `Phase75PublicationPlan` with its V3 builder/validator; require the exact six V3 paths and ordered roles; add exactly `tests/fixtures/nar_race_entry_status/source_profiles/v3/**/*.html -text -diff`; and set future live `.gitattributes` behavior to `VALIDATE_ONLY`. The publication-plan module remains pure: no network, subprocess, database, clock, randomness, filesystem write, raw bytes, or arbitrary URLs.

V3 plan authority is fixed to `NAR / 21 / 2025-01-01 / 6`, with V3 Deba/RaceList/manifest paths under `tests/fixtures/nar_race_entry_status/source_profiles/v3/baba_21__2025-01-01__race_06/`, dedicated test `tests/test_nar_race_entry_status_source_profile_v3_fixtures.py`, four `CREATE_ONLY` entries, and two documentation `MODIFY_EXISTING` entries. The future fixture-test requirements include exact hashes/lengths/target/roles; V3 fixture/qualification/manifest recomputation and validation; Safety-v3 SAFE; Profile-A-v3 and Profile-B-v2 qualification; all six Profile-B predicates; corrected Profile-B/Phase66 direct-schedule consistency; current-acquisition semantics; unsupported market eligibility; and no network.

Readiness A–R: `YES`. No additional support is required. Provider HTTP / Phase44 / GET: `0 / 0 / 0`. Acquisition authorization issued: `NONE`. Publication: `NOT PERFORMED`. Staged: empty. Untracked: empty.

Next recommended action: `CHATGPT_REVIEW_PHASE75_PUBLICATION_PLAN_DESIGN`.

## Phase74 approval report

Phase: `POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_74`

State: `APPROVED_UNCONSUMED_TRACKED`

Authorization Tracking State: `APPROVED_UNCONSUMED_TRACKED`

Formal Status: `APPROVED_FOR_CODEX`

Design Review: `PHASE74_VALIDATION_DESIGN_REVIEW_PASS`

Outcome: `APPROVED_PROFILE_B_V2_REPAIRED_FRESH_CURRENT_VALIDATION`

Validation Contract: `PROFILE_B_V2_REPAIRED_FRESH_CURRENT_VALIDATION_CONTRACT_COMPLETE`

Authorization: `PHASE74_VERSIONED_SOURCE_PROFILE_VALIDATION_AUTHORIZATION_UNCONSUMED`

Worktree: `C:\Users\garim\Desktop\KeibaOS-post-v0.8`

Executable support HEAD/tree: `b2355113f969f6af713a254355e67a9feab5cc45` / `24b4f37391039e1ece2d573b4a0ea3f0de65e4cd`

Approval Base HEAD: `b2355113f969f6af713a254355e67a9feab5cc45`

### Authorization binding

This is a new Phase74 one-shot authorization, not a retry or reuse of Phase72. It binds to target `NAR / 21 / 2025-01-01 / 6`, purpose `FRESH_CURRENT_VALIDATION_AFTER_PHASE73_PROFILE_B_V2_REPAIR`, semantics `CURRENT_ACQUISITION_CONCERNING_HISTORICAL_TARGET`, and the stated executable support HEAD. The reserved permanent consumed state is `PHASE74_VERSIONED_SOURCE_PROFILE_VALIDATION_AUTHORIZATION_CONSUMED_FAIL_CLOSED`.

At approval time: Provider HTTP / Phase44 / GET are `0 / 0 / 0`; synthetic and live execution are `NOT RUN`; the boundary is not written; and authorization is not consumed.

### Frozen authority

Phase73 is `FORMALLY_COMPLETE`, with `PROFILE_B_V2_CHANGEINFO_CLASS_TOKEN_REPAIRED` and review `PHASE73_IMPLEMENTATION_REMOTE_VERIFICATION_PASS`.

Phase72 remains final: `POST_AUTHORIZATION_STOP` / `RECOVERY_PREFLIGHT_BLOCKED` / `PHASE72_VERSIONED_SOURCE_PROFILE_VALIDATION_AUTHORIZATION_CONSUMED_FAIL_CLOSED`. Its durable boundary, one Phase44, two GETs, zero retry, no publication, and blocker `PROFILE_B_STRUCTURAL_CONSISTENCY` remain unchanged. It is permanently unusable.

### Future Phase74 controls

Only Profile-B v2 schema `2`, Profile-A v3 schema `3`, and Safety v3 schema `3` qualify Phase74. Phase50 retains journal schema `1`, supported nested schema versions, and the schema-3 Profile-A target/TARGET_CONSTRUCTED equality contract. Phase63 and Phase66 are supplemental only.

The synthetic success path must reproduce the Phase72 sibling schedule/changeInfo topology and prove: Profile-B v2 target count `1`, all six predicates `PASS`, `QUALIFIED`; Phase63 candidates `2`; Phase66 candidates `2`, direct schedule `1`, changeInfo `1`. Corrected structural consistency compares only Profile-B v2 count to the Phase66 direct-schedule count. It expressly does not compare against Phase63 or Phase66 total candidates.

Mandatory gates include `PHASE73_PROFILE_B_V2_CHANGEINFO_TOKEN_INTEGRATION_PASS`, `PHASE71_PROFILE_A_V3_TARGET_CONTRACT_INTEGRATION_PASS`, both blocked-v3 Phase50 probes, Profile-B/Profile-A/Safety dry-run gates, full Phase50 reconstruction, no-network proof, runner-byte parity, and capture metadata/bundle identity proof.

The hardened runner remains one generated external file with shared synthetic/live logic, fresh `-I -B` imports, KeibaAI exclusion, origin checks, and exact LF preflight bytes. The sole future boundary is durable `PHASE44_CALL_ABOUT_TO_ENTER`; caps remain Phase44 `1`, Deba GET `1`, RaceList GET `1`, total GET `2`, in order, with no retry/fallback/discovery.

Publication is prohibited. Safe-final is bounded; raw/provider artifacts are removed after parent validation. Current-byte matches remain `CURRENT_ACQUISITION_BYTES_REPRODUCED` only and do not establish historical availability, state, timing, cutoff, or market eligibility. Market eligibility remains `UNSUPPORTED`.

No production or test file changed in approval. No authorization was consumed.

Next permitted action: `TRACK_PHASE74_AUTHORIZATION_STATE_THEN_INDEPENDENT_REMOTE_VERIFICATION`.
