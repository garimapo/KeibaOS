## POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_79 — IMPLEMENTED

**State:** IMPLEMENTED_FOR_REVIEW
**Outcome:** READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW
**Support:** V3_DEDICATED_FIXTURE_TEST_EXECUTION_AND_FAILURE_EVIDENCE_AUTHORITY_IMPLEMENTED

Implementation is confined to the approved six paths. The pure renderer implements `render_nar_race_entry_status_source_profile_v3_fixture_test(*, deba_table_bytes, race_list_bytes, manifest, publication_plan) -> bytes`, exact V3 type/authority and raw-byte validation, portable local-only generated tests, and the 65536-byte source limit.

The preflight constructs deterministic qualified synthetic authority with Phase63/Phase66 counts 2 / 2, direct schedule 1, changeInfo 1, and structural consistency 1 == 1. It writes only to a temporary external mirror, runs the generated test through `python -I -B` and actual pytest, validates the sole PEP 420 namespace and all module origins, disables ambient plugin/PYTHONPATH influence, and cleans the mirror.

Actual preflight result:

- Gate: V3_DEDICATED_FIXTURE_TEST_END_TO_END_PREFLIGHT_PASS.
- Generated pytest tests: 4 passed; return code 0.
- Import isolation: PASS.
- Generated source SHA/length: `447535319ad465f44df2fd1e03cab6988d284ea5431e9badc01454e3de7264ef` / 10462.
- Manifest SHA/length: `0be206f04b8a7a4a6bffa3bc83e6eb8527a034870ecf82366b995f8be338eb46` / 4247.
- Command identity: `phase79-pytest-command-v1:db816856de1217bc1e9ea068fd4724be62baed2e09df19931dbe4ecd664725db`.
- Process output used Phase50 sanitization; stdout was bounded/redacted with full digest/length and stderr was EMPTY.

The focused suite proves exact-type/V2/dict/duck rejection, raw hash/length consistency, formal authority rejection, repeatable UTF-8 LF-only compilable output, nine actual-pytest mutations, missing/alternate/import-origin/namespace fail-closed behavior, no provider-network calls, bounded manifest retention, safe failure-node extraction, and durable exclusive-write/flush/fsync/readback evidence before rollback.

Final required test counts:

- generator 17 passed
- preflight 17 passed
- publication plan 45 passed
- publication contract 49 passed
- Profile-B diagnostics 38 passed
- Profile-A 17 passed
- Phase66 structural recovery 152 passed
- Phase50 observability 367 passed
- full suite 4383 passed, 2841 subtests passed

Phase76 remains TERMINAL_CONSUMED_BLOCKED_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE with cause UNKNOWN_AFTER_BOUNDED_EVIDENCE_GAP. Phase78 remains NOT_ENTERED_NO_PUBLICATION_DELTA. Provider HTTP / Phase44 / GET are 0 / 0 / 0; authorization is NONE; publication is NO. A future Phase80-or-later live phase requires a new reviewed one-shot authorization and the committed preflight gate.

Next action: `CHATGPT_REVIEW_PHASE79_IMPLEMENTATION`.

## POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_79 — APPROVE

**Formal Status:** APPROVED_FOR_CODEX
**Outcome:** APPROVED_V3_DEDICATED_FIXTURE_TEST_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION
**Design Review:** PHASE79_DEDICATED_TEST_HARDENING_DESIGN_REVIEW_PASS

The executable contract is recorded for branch `feature/post-v0.8-daily-replay`, base commit `e1e176291e0a79ad79f807c64b35d67da4851469`, and base tree `d2d1593adfa95835ed59d37cb0e35f33945e118b`. The future execution scope is exactly the two new source modules, their two focused tests, and these two documents; all other paths are forbidden.

The approved renderer is `render_nar_race_entry_status_source_profile_v3_fixture_test(*, deba_table_bytes, race_list_bytes, manifest, publication_plan) -> bytes`. It validates exact V3 authority and raw-byte consistency, generates bounded portable UTF-8/LF source, and remains pure. The approved preflight runs the committed renderer against an external synthetic mirror through isolated `python -I -B` pytest with PEP 420/module-origin checks and bounded evidence retention before any future rollback.

Phase76 remains TERMINAL_CONSUMED_BLOCKED_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE with permanently consumed authorization and an UNKNOWN_AFTER_BOUNDED_EVIDENCE_GAP; Phase78 remains NOT_ENTERED_NO_PUBLICATION_DELTA. This approval performed no code/test implementation, tests, provider HTTP, Phase44, GET, authorization, publication, staging, commit, or push.

Next action: `EXECUTE_APPROVED_PHASE`.

## POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_79 — IMPLEMENTATION CONTRACT BLOCKED

Implementation did not start.

- Requested review: `PHASE79_DEDICATED_TEST_HARDENING_DESIGN_REVIEW_PASS`
- Requested state: `APPROVED_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION`
- Contract blocker: `PHASE79_EXECUTION_CONTRACT_NOT_APPROVED_FOR_CODEX`
- Current `docs/CURRENT_PHASE.md` status: `DRAFT_FOR_REVIEW`
- Current allowed scope remains the PREPARE-only two-document scope and explicitly forbids production/test implementation.
- The current phase document does not yet declare the approved Base Commit and Branch, exact six implementation Allowed Files, Forbidden Files, and Required Tests as an `APPROVED_FOR_CODEX` execution contract.
- The prepared renderer API also differs from the newly requested implementation API and must be resolved in the approved phase contract rather than inferred during implementation.
- No production code, tests, staging, commit, push, network, Phase44, GET, authorization, or publication activity occurred.

Required next action: approve/correct `docs/CURRENT_PHASE.md` using the repository workflow, then issue `EXECUTE_APPROVED_PHASE`.

## POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_79 — PREPARE

**Status:** DRAFT_FOR_REVIEW
**Outcome:** READY_FOR_APPROVAL
**Design contract:** V3_DEDICATED_FIXTURE_TEST_EXECUTION_AND_FAILURE_EVIDENCE_AUTHORITY_COMPLETE

Phase79 is documentation-only preparation. It performed no provider HTTP, Phase44, GET, acquisition authorization, reacquisition, publication, staging, commit, or push.

### Frozen Phase76 result

- Review: PHASE76_CONSUMED_BLOCKED_RESULT_REVIEW_PASS.
- Terminal semantic: TERMINAL_CONSUMED_BLOCKED_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE.
- Phase50 outcome: RECOVERY_PREFLIGHT_BLOCKED.
- External authorization is permanently PHASE76_V3_SOURCE_PROFILE_PUBLICATION_AUTHORIZATION_CONSUMED_FAIL_CLOSED; Phase50 reconstructed CONSUMED_CONFIRMED.
- Live evidence retained only: Phase44 1; Deba GET 1; RaceList GET 1; total GET 2; retry 0.
- Deba SHA/length: `6c9aa3ea614c17e14f0e7a5050190ca923445925d67f8e61e71db95e87c87727` / 313317.
- RaceList SHA/length: `1eb363621c7a152929765ff7ffecabea2d7cf15283d45fa9c31036527c0b53a1` / 66307.
- Profile-B v2 QUALIFIED; Safety v3 SAFE; Profile-A v3 QUALIFIED.
- FixtureSetV3 identity: `nar-race-entry-status-source-profile-fixture-set-v3:20d14faad781a11dddba49f364745d302365bc639f5092d82f255597f8e75a90`.
- QualificationV3 identity: `nar-race-entry-status-source-profile-qualification-v3:ca0a3022ade5cf661018b226f69e0bba3a88d747dd205838122d191cf4d7e2d9`.

The exact blocker was REGRESSION_FAILURE_AT_DEDICATED_V3_FIXTURE_TEST. Its cause is UNKNOWN_AFTER_BOUNDED_EVIDENCE_GAP: generated source, pytest output/node, and manifest SHA/length were unavailable after rollback. No cause or patch is inferred. PUBLICATION_BEGIN through DEDICATED_TEST_WRITTEN were reached, REGRESSIONS_PASS was not, and rollback completed. Phase78 is NOT_ENTERED_NO_PUBLICATION_DELTA.

### Proposed reviewed authority

Later implementation is expected to add a pure deterministic V3 test-source renderer at `scripts/simulation/nar_race_entry_status_source_profile_fixture_test_generator.py`, plus a separate no-network external-mirror/evidence harness at `scripts/simulation/nar_race_entry_status_source_profile_fixture_test_preflight.py`, focused tests, and documents. The renderer accepts exact `FixtureSetV3`, `QualificationV3`, and `SourceProfileManifestV3`, validates existing authority, derives canonical values, and returns canonical UTF-8 LF-only source bytes. It is pure: no filesystem writes, network, clock, environment lookup, randomness, subprocess, or provider access.

The renderer must derive requirements solely from `FUTURE_OFFICIAL_FIXTURE_TEST_REQUIREMENTS_V3` and existing V3 fixture, qualification, manifest, and publication-plan authority. The generated portable test uses `Path(__file__)`, approved relative paths, and local files only.

### End-to-end and evidence plan

The required future `V3_DEDICATED_FIXTURE_TEST_END_TO_END_PREFLIGHT_PASS` uses the same renderer as live publication in an external deterministic synthetic mirror and executes actual pytest. A deterministic `python -I -B` wrapper injects only reviewed KeibaOS support and validates PEP 420 `scripts` namespace and authority-module origins; it rejects ambient PYTHONPATH, KeibaAI, site-package shadows, and alternate worktrees. If this cannot be proven, stop with DESIGN_BLOCKED_IMPORT_ISOLATION_FOR_EXTERNAL_PYTEST.

Renderer tests will prove exact-type rejection, determinism, canonical source, compilation, and no time/random/environment influence. End-to-end mutation tests will prove failure for independently changed fixture bytes, manifest bytes, expected hash/length, target, fixture/qualification identity, and market eligibility.

Before a future rollback, bounded evidence must be retained and fsynced: safe generated source; source/fixture/manifest hashes and lengths; V3 identities; command/return-code; milestone; and safe bounded pytest diagnostics. Valid canonical V3 manifest bytes are retainable only when at most 16384 bytes because their reviewed schema contains metadata, identities, hashes, and lengths—not raw HTML, URLs, cookies, or credentials. Otherwise only a safe projection is retained and publication blocks pending review. Raw process streams are not retained wholesale: use digest, length, classification, conservative test-node extraction, and a mechanically safe excerpt only where permitted.

Phase79 has no authorization. A new one-shot Phase80 authorization is required after formal Phase79 review, and Phase80 must pass the end-to-end preflight before any live boundary. Historical non-inference remains fixed: market_eligibility, positive_market_eligibility, and WHOLE_MEETING_CANCELLATION are UNSUPPORTED.

### Readiness

Readiness A–U: YES. No blocker was identified for the design. The next action is CHATGPT_REVIEW_PHASE79_DEDICATED_TEST_HARDENING_DESIGN.

## Phase76 approval report

Authorization Tracking State: `APPROVED_UNCONSUMED_TRACKED`

Formal Status: `APPROVED_FOR_CODEX`

Outcome: `APPROVED_V3_PUBLICATION_DELTA_GENERATION`

Authorization: `PHASE76_V3_SOURCE_PROFILE_PUBLICATION_AUTHORIZATION_UNCONSUMED`

Support HEAD/tree: `cd9a728d04aab69a2330ee7f23583318c1901386` / `ce7e18d940fac243766f24237b6cc54d956c94d0`

Approval Base HEAD: `cd9a728d04aab69a2330ee7f23583318c1901386`

Executable Support HEAD: `cd9a728d04aab69a2330ee7f23583318c1901386`

Executable Support Tree: `ce7e18d940fac243766f24237b6cc54d956c94d0`

The authorization is one-shot, phase/target/purpose/support-HEAD-specific, nontransferable, and permanently becomes `PHASE76_V3_SOURCE_PROFILE_PUBLICATION_AUTHORIZATION_CONSUMED_FAIL_CLOSED` only after durable Phase44 boundary evidence. Its external state is intentionally distinct from Phase50's reconstructed journal state: the expected normal run has external consumed fail-closed state and journal `CONSUMED_CONFIRMED` after observing `PHASE44_FUNCTION_ENTERED`.

Phase77 is `FORMALLY_COMPLETE` with `PHASE77_IMPLEMENTATION_REMOTE_VERIFICATION_PASS` and exact V3 dedicated-test-path support. Phase75 is `FORMALLY_COMPLETE` with its V3 publication-plan authority. Phase74 authorization remains permanently consumed fail-closed. The approved design retains the no-Git Phase76 publication delta and separate Phase78 integration model, all pre-live gates, exact six paths, same-byte authority/qualification/readback controls, rollback before completion, bounded evidence, and historical non-inference.

This APPROVE activity performed no provider HTTP, Phase44, GET, synthetic/live run, publication, boundary write, staging, commit, or push. Authorization consumed: `NO`. The only modified paths are the two Phase documents; staged and untracked remain empty.

Next permitted action: `INDEPENDENT_REMOTE_VERIFICATION_BEFORE_PHASE76_EXECUTE`.

## Phase76 corrected publication-design report

Phase: `POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_76`

Status: `DRAFT_FOR_REVIEW`

Outcome: `READY_FOR_APPROVAL`

Design Contract: `V3_PUBLICATION_DELTA_REVIEW_BEFORE_GIT_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_COMPLETE`

Current support HEAD/tree: `cd9a728d04aab69a2330ee7f23583318c1901386` / `ce7e18d940fac243766f24237b6cc54d956c94d0`

Phase77 is `FORMALLY_COMPLETE` with `PHASE77_IMPLEMENTATION_REMOTE_VERIFICATION_PASS`. Its exact Phase50 V3 dedicated-test path support resolves `PHASE50_V3_DEDICATED_TEST_PATH_ALLOWLIST_MISSING`; the corrected Phase76 binding is now support-HEAD-specific to the Phase77 commit. No Phase76 authorization has been issued.

The corrected transaction model is `PUBLICATION_DELTA_AND_GIT_INTEGRATION_SPLIT`: Phase76 creates and validates the exact six-path unstaged V3 publication delta, retains bounded evidence, and stops for independent review. It never stages, commits, or pushes. Phase78 later performs no-network integration. If a Phase78 commit succeeds but push fails, it preserves the immutable local commit as `LOCAL_PUBLICATION_COMMIT_PUSH_PENDING_REVIEW`; it never resets, amends, force-pushes, reacquires, or reruns Phase76.

Phase76 preserves all existing synthetic gates and adds the actual `PHASE50_V3_DEDICATED_TEST_PATH_INTEGRATION_PASS`, V3 plan/contract/template/rollback gates, exact attribute validation, and CREATE_ONLY absence gates. A future publication requires one durable authorization boundary, exactly one Phase44, ordered Deba/RaceList GETs capped at two, same-byte qualification and V3 object validation, readback verification, generated no-network dedicated test, and passing regressions. Any pre-commit publication failure rolls back only the six live paths.

Semantics remain `CURRENT_ACQUISITION_CONCERNING_HISTORICAL_TARGET`; market eligibility, positive market eligibility, and `WHOLE_MEETING_CANCELLATION` remain `UNSUPPORTED`. No historical inference is allowed.

Readiness A–U: `YES`. Provider HTTP / Phase44 / GET: `0 / 0 / 0`. Authorization issued: `NONE`. Publication: `NOT PERFORMED`. Staged: empty. Untracked: empty.

Next recommended action: `CHATGPT_REVIEW_CORRECTED_PHASE76_PUBLICATION_DESIGN`.

## Phase77 implementation report

Phase: `POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_77`

State: `IMPLEMENTED_FOR_REVIEW`

Outcome: `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW`

Support Repair: `PHASE50_V3_DEDICATED_TEST_PATH_SUPPORT_ADDED`

Starting HEAD/tree: `c6522eacf46f03036e1171f14f634983c1f73479` / `e5df986b4788afb3a22507767767580ad399a880`

Phase76 is frozen `DESIGN_BLOCKED_ADDITIONAL_SUPPORT_REQUIRED`. Its primary blocker was `PHASE50_V3_DEDICATED_TEST_PATH_ALLOWLIST_MISSING`; the separate `PUBLICATION_COMMIT_PUSH_ROLLBACK_BOUNDARY_REQUIRES_DESIGN_CORRECTION` remains for the corrected later publication design. Before commit the live publication delta remains rollback-capable; after a successful commit, push failure must preserve the local commit and enter integration recovery rather than reset, amend, force, reacquire, or restart the publication transaction.

Phase50 now accepts exactly the historical V1 path, V2 path, and `tests/test_nar_race_entry_status_source_profile_v3_fixtures.py`. It rejects all malformed V3 variants and arbitrary paths. Journal schema `1`, milestone order, `{test_path}` detail shape, size limits, outcomes, authorization states, and existing V3 manifest identity-pair support are unchanged. A successful V3 publication journal using V3 fixture/qualification identities and the V3 dedicated path passes syntax, semantic validation, and reconstruction with publication begun and no rollback.

Verification: Phase50 `367 passed`; publication plan `45 passed`; publication contract `49 passed`; full repository `4349 passed, 2841 subtests passed`. Provider HTTP / Phase44 / GET: `0 / 0 / 0`. Acquisition authorization: `NONE`. Publication authorization: `NONE`. Publication: `NO`.

Phase75 remains `FORMALLY_COMPLETE`; Phase74 authorization remains permanently consumed fail-closed. Market eligibility remains `UNSUPPORTED`; no historical inference is made.

## Phase76 publication preparation report

Phase: `POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_76`

Status: `DRAFT_FOR_REVIEW`

Outcome: `READY_FOR_APPROVAL`

Design Contract: `V3_FRESH_CURRENT_ACQUISITION_AND_PUBLICATION_CONTRACT_COMPLETE`

Worktree: `C:\Users\garim\Desktop\KeibaOS-post-v0.8`

Current support HEAD/tree: `c6522eacf46f03036e1171f14f634983c1f73479` / `e5df986b4788afb3a22507767767580ad399a880`

Phase75 is frozen `FORMALLY_COMPLETE` with `PHASE75_IMPLEMENTATION_REMOTE_VERIFICATION_PASS`; its V3 publication-plan authority, exact six-path plan, closed FixtureSetV3 validation, `VALIDATE_ONLY` attribute policy, and tracked V3 binary rule are available. Phase74 remains final with permanently consumed Phase74 authorization; its raw bytes were cleaned and cannot be reconstructed or reused.

Preparation found no additional support gap. The exact four V3 CREATE_ONLY targets are absent, and the committed V3 `.gitattributes` rule is present. Phase76 reserves, but does not issue, `PHASE76_V3_SOURCE_PROFILE_PUBLICATION_AUTHORIZATION_UNCONSUMED` bound only to `NAR / 21 / 2025-01-01 / 6`, purpose `FRESH_CURRENT_V3_SOURCE_PROFILE_ACQUISITION_AND_PUBLICATION`, current-acquisition semantics, and the current support HEAD. Its sole post-boundary state is permanent consumed fail-closed.

The reviewed future execution uses a one-time frozen external runner; namespace-package import isolation; complete synthetic qualification, Phase50 blocked-payload, V3 contract, test-template, rollback, attribute, and CREATE_ONLY absence gates; then exactly one Phase44 and at most two ordered GETs. It retains the same fresh raw bytes through all qualification and V3 authority construction. Only fully qualified same-byte evidence may reach `PUBLICATION_BEGIN`, raw fixture readback, manifest readback, deterministic dedicated test generation, documentation update, regression tests, six-path staging, commit, and normal push. Any post-publication failure rolls back exactly the six live paths and does not retry.

Current-acquisition semantics are preserved throughout: no historical bytes, provider availability, timing, cutoff, or market eligibility are inferred. `market_eligibility`, `positive_market_eligibility`, and `WHOLE_MEETING_CANCELLATION` remain `UNSUPPORTED`.

Readiness A–T: `YES`. Provider HTTP / Phase44 / GET: `0 / 0 / 0`. Authorization issued: `NONE`. Publication: `NOT PERFORMED`. Staged: empty. Untracked: empty.

Next recommended action: `CHATGPT_REVIEW_PHASE76_PUBLICATION_DESIGN`.

## Phase75 implementation report

Phase: `POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_75`

State: `IMPLEMENTED_FOR_REVIEW`

Outcome: `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW`

Support: `V3_SOURCE_PROFILE_PUBLICATION_PLAN_AUTHORITY_IMPLEMENTED`

The implementation adds additive, deterministic, fail-closed V3 publication-plan authority while preserving all V2 constants, types, paths, builders, validators, and tests. It introduces `SourceProfilePublicationPlanV3`, exact `FixtureSetV3` input validation, exact V3 NAR target/path authority, ordered six-role plans, future `VALIDATE_ONLY` gitattributes policy, exact rollback scope, and the frozen V3 fixture-test requirement tuple. V2 and V3 inputs and plan types cross-reject; the V3 plan has no independent identity.

The V3 HTML binary rule is now tracked exactly once: `tests/fixtures/nar_race_entry_status/source_profiles/v3/**/*.html -text -diff`; the V2 rule remains exactly once. The plan module remains pure: no network, subprocess, filesystem write, raw bytes, arbitrary URLs, or live acquisition capability.

Phase74 remains `FORMALLY_COMPLETE` with evidence review `PHASE74_VERSIONED_VALIDATION_EVIDENCE_REVIEW_PASS`; its authorization remains permanently consumed fail-closed. Raw V3 fixtures and manifests are `NOT_PUBLISHED`. Future publication requires a new one-shot authorization bound to the reviewed post-Phase75 support. Market eligibility remains `UNSUPPORTED`; no historical inference is made.

Verification completed: publication-plan tests `45 passed`; publication-contract tests `49 passed`; specified related diagnostics/Profile-A/Phase66/Phase50 regressions `562 passed`; full repository suite `4337 passed, 2841 subtests passed`. Provider HTTP / Phase44 / GET: `0 / 0 / 0`. Acquisition authorization: `NONE`. Publication: `NO`.

Next permitted action: `CHATGPT_REVIEW_PHASE75_IMPLEMENTATION`.

## Phase75 preparation report

Phase: `POST_V0_8_DAILY_REPLAY_75`

Status: `DRAFT_FOR_REVIEW`

Outcome: `READY_FOR_APPROVAL`

Design Contract: `V3_SOURCE_PROFILE_PUBLICATION_PLAN_CONTRACT_COMPLETE`

Worktree: `C:\Users\garim\Desktop\KeibaOS-post-v0.8`

Starting tracking HEAD: `11e1aace4aae68640d0d38f88b38873d1bac5abd`

Validated executable support HEAD/tree: `b2355113f969f6af713a254355e67a9feab5cc45` / `24b4f37391039e1ece2d573b4a0ea3f0de65e4cd`

Phase74 is frozen `FORMALLY_COMPLETE` with evidence review `PHASE74_VERSIONED_VALIDATION_EVIDENCE_REVIEW_PASS`, outcome `READY_FOR_REVIEW`, and permanently consumed authorization `PHASE74_VERSIONED_SOURCE_PROFILE_VALIDATION_AUTHORIZATION_CONSUMED_FAIL_CLOSED`. Its current-only Profile-B v2 `QUALIFIED`, Safety v3 `SAFE`, Profile-A v3 `QUALIFIED`, durable boundary, Phase44 `1`, total GET `2`, retry `0`, and no-publication result remain evidence only. Raw bytes are unavailable and must not be reconstructed or substituted.

Preparation confirmed that V3 contract authority already exists: exact `FixtureSetV3`, `QualificationV3`, `SourceProfileManifestV3`, `RawFixturePublicationSafetyV3`, their V3 builders/validators, deterministic V3 paths, semantics `CURRENT_ACQUISITION_CONCERNING_HISTORICAL_TARGET`, and market eligibility `UNSUPPORTED`.

The existing publication plan is strictly V2-only: it accepts only exact `FixtureSetV2`, uses V2 fixture paths and requirements, and preserves Phase57 V2 authority. `.gitattributes` presently preserves only V2 source-profile HTML. A direct V3 publication is therefore not authorized.

The reviewed additive Phase75 implementation is limited to five paths:

1. `scripts/simulation/nar_race_entry_status_source_profile_publication_plan.py`
2. `tests/test_nar_race_entry_status_source_profile_publication_plan.py`
3. `.gitattributes`
4. `docs/CURRENT_PHASE.md`
5. `docs/LATEST_CODEX_REPORT.md`

It will retain every V2 type, constant, path, builder, validator, and golden behavior unchanged; add a distinct exact-FixtureSetV3 `Phase75PublicationPlan` with its V3 builder/validator; require the exact six V3 paths and ordered roles; add exactly `tests/fixtures/nar_race_entry_status/source_profiles/v3/**/*.html -text -diff`; and set future live `.gitattributes` behavior to `VALIDATE_ONLY`. The publication-plan module remains pure: no network, subprocess, database, clock, randomness, filesystem write, raw bytes, or arbitrary URLs.

V3 plan authority is fixed to `NAR / 21 / 2025-01-01 / 6`, with V3 Deba/RaceList/manifest paths under `tests/fixtures/nar_race_entry_status/source_profiles/v3/baba_21__2025-01-01__race_06/`, dedicated test `tests/test_nar_race_entry_status_source_profile_v3_fixtures.py`, four `CREATE_ONLY` entries, and two documentation `MODIFY_EXISTING` entries. The future fixture-test requirements include exact hashes/lengths/target/roles; V3 fixture/qualification/manifest recomputation and validation; Safety-v3 SAFE; Profile-A-v3 and Profile-B-v2 qualification; all six Profile-B predicates; corrected Profile-B/Phase66 direct-schedule consistency; current-acquisition semantics; unsupported market eligibility; and no network.

Readiness A–R: `YES`. No additional support is required. Provider HTTP / Phase44 / GET: `0 / 0 / 0`. Acquisition authorization issued: `NONE`. Publication: `NOT PERFORMED`. Staged: empty. Untracked: empty.

Next recommended action: `CHATGPT_REVIEW_PHASE75_PUBLICATION_PLAN_DESIGN`.

Approval Base HEAD: `b2355113f969f6af713a254355e67a9feab5cc45`

### Authorization binding

This is a new Phase74 one-shot authorization, not a retry or reuse of Phase72. It binds to target `NAR / 21 / 2025-01-01 / 6`, purpose `FRESH_CURRENT_VALIDATION_AFTER_PHASE73_PROFILE_B_V2_REPAIR`, semantics `CURRENT_ACQUISITION_CONCERNING_HISTORICAL_TARGET`, and the stated executable support HEAD. The reserved permanent consumed state is `PHASE74_VERSIONED_SOURCE_PROFILE_VALIDATION_AUTHORIZATION_CONSUMED_FAIL_CLOSED`.

At approval time: Provider HTTP / Phase44 / GET are `0 / 0 / 0`; synthetic and live execution are `NOT RUN`; the boundary is not written; and authorization is not consumed.

### Frozen authority

Phase73 is `FORMALLY_COMPLETE`, with `PROFILE_B_V2_CHANGEINFO_CLASS_TOKEN_REPAIRED` and review `PHASE73_IMPLEMENTATION_REMOTE_VERIFICATION_PASS`.

Phase72 remains final: `POST_AUTHORIZATION_STOP` / `RECOVERY_PREFLIGHT_BLOCKED` / `PHASE72_VERSIONED_SOURCE_PROFILE_VALIDATION_AUTHORIZATION_CONSUMED_FAIL_CLOSED`. Its durable boundary, one Phase44, two GETs, zero retry, no publication, and blocker `PROFILE_B_STRUCTURAL_CONSISTENCY` remain unchanged. It is permanently unusable.

### Future Phase74 controls

Only Profile-B v2 schema `2`, Profile-A v3 schema `3`, and Safety v3 schema `3` qualify Phase74. Phase50 retains journal schema `1`, supported nested schema versions, and the schema-3 Profile-A target/TARGET_CONSTRUCTED equality contract. Phase63 and Phase66 are supplemental only.

The synthetic success path must reproduce the Phase72 sibling schedule/changeInfo topology and prove: Profile-B v2 target count `1`, all six predicates `PASS`, `QUALIFIED`; Phase63 candidates `2`; Phase66 candidates `2`, direct schedule `1`, changeInfo `1`. Corrected structural consistency compares only Profile-B v2 count to the Phase66 direct-schedule count. It expressly does not compare against Phase63 or Phase66 total candidates.

Mandatory gates include `PHASE73_PROFILE_B_V2_CHANGEINFO_TOKEN_INTEGRATION_PASS`, `PHASE71_PROFILE_A_V3_TARGET_CONTRACT_INTEGRATION_PASS`, both blocked-v3 Phase50 probes, Profile-B/Profile-A/Safety dry-run gates, full Phase50 reconstruction, no-network proof, runner-byte parity, and capture metadata/bundle identity proof.

The hardened runner remains one generated external file with shared synthetic/live logic, fresh `-I -B` imports, KeibaAI exclusion, origin checks, and exact LF preflight bytes.
